# Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About Me

⌛ This is Debmalya Mondal (Deb), having over a decade (12 years) of experience in Fintech industry. I have served many roles starting from back-end Java developer to QA Lead and currently executing my responsibilities as Technical Business Analyst specialized in Capital Markets, Wealth Management domain.

💻 While my role demands of me having significant understanding of the underlying technology of the system, I too personally have a genuine belief of continuous learning of new technology trends. There are a few technology drivers that are literally revolutionalizing the Banking & Financial Sector (BFS), Machine Learning is something that draws the maximum interests in me and hence I learnt (or learning) ML concepts. Recently, I have started my 👉 [blog](https://medium.com/@wetechfin) to discuss on the upcoming trends that are literally changing the fintech business landscape.

📚 Outside of work, I love reading books. During my school days I read a lot of fictional books by Saratchandra Chatterjee or Rabindranath Tagore like renowned novelist. However, since last couple of years I read mostly self improvement non-fiction books. The latest book I read is "The Tipping Point" by Malcolm Gladwell. Few of my favourite books which I feel everyone should read are "Atomic Habits" by James Clear, "Ikigai" by Hector Garcia & Francesc Miralles and "The Psychology of Money" by Morgan Housel.

🍲 I am very fond of cooking as well. When I first came out of my 🏠 to pursue my career, cooking was only a need. But later on I developed passion for cooking and in turn try different cuisines to satisfy my inner foodie 😋🍽️. However, I strongly believe that cooking is an essential life skill and everyone must know at least the basics of it.

🏍️ Like most of the Indian boys, motocycle is ❤️ for me too. Even a quick ride on my bike around the city gives me immense peace and satisfaction.
